\title{Gomez formulas for renal afferent/efferent resistance}
\usage{
calculate_gomez(GFR, RPF, Hct, TP, sbp, dbp, hr, DM = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{GFR}{Glomerular filtration rate measured by iohexol clearance or other
precise method (mL/min)}

\item{RPF}{Renal plasms flow, determined by PAH infusion (mL/min)}

\item{Hct}{Hematocrit (fraction)}

\item{TP}{Total protein concentration (mg/dL, plasma)}

\item{sbp}{Systolic Blood pressure (mmHg)}

\item{dbp}{Diastolic Blood pressure (mmHg)}

\item{hr}{Heart rate (bpm)}

\item{DM}{Diabetes (\code{T}/\code{F}). defaults to \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
Data.frame of calculated values
}
\description{
Calculates renal resistance measures using the formulas originally reported
by \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14888692/}{Gomez}, referred to as
the "Gomez Formulas". For review of this method see
\href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27605583/}{Bjornstad}. For discussion
of the additionally reported A value see \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1860182/}{Kimura.}
}
\details{
Assumptions imposed by Gomez equations are as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Intrarenal vascular resistances are divided into afferent, postglomerular, and efferent
\item Hydrostatic pressures within the renal tubules, venules, Bowmanâ€™s space, and interstitium (PBow) are in equilibrium of 10 mmHg
\item Glomerulus is  in filtration disequilibrium
\item Gross filtration coefficient KF is 0.0867mL/s/ mmHg given a normal kidney.
