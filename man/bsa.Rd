\usage{
bsa(
  weight,
  height,
  weight_units = "kg",
  height_units = "m",
  method = "Mosteller"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight}{Body Weight (kg)}

\item{height}{Body Height (m)}

\item{weight_units}{If `weight` is in Units other than kg, specifiy here to  properly convert for calucations ("kg", "g", or "lbs")}

\item{height_units}{If `height` is in Units other than m, specifiy here to  properly convert for calucations ("m", "cm", or "in")}

\item{method}{Which BSA formula to use for calculation ()}
}
\value{
a numeric vector with Body Surface Area (BSA, m^2)
}
\description{
Calculates Body Surface Area (m2) by several common methods. Converts weight to Kg and Height to cm if needed. Avaialbe methods for BSA calculations include:

  *  Mosteller: SQRT(Ht(cm) x Wt(kg) / 3600   
  *  DuBois and DuBois: Wt(kg)^(0.425) x Ht(cm)^(0.725) x 0.007184  
  *  Gehan and George: Wt(kg)^(0.51456) x Ht(cm)^(0.42246) x 0.0235  
  *  Haycock: Wt(kg)^(0.5378) x Ht(cm)^(0.3964) x 0.024265  
  *  Yu: 71.3989 x Ht(cm)^(0.7437) x Wt(kg)^(0.4040) / 10000  
  *  Livingston: 0.1173 x Wt(kg)^(0.6466)   
  *  Tikuisis: 128.1 x Ht(cm)^(0.60) x Wt(kg)^(0.44)
